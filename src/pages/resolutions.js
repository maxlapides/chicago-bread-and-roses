            to support our resolution on Adopting a National Tasks and
            Perspectives Document for YDSA!
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas, as the youth wing of Democratic Socialists America, the
          largest socialist organization in the United States in nearly a
          century, YDSA has a unique role to play in the US left, as a force
          that can activate, educate, and train young people to become lifelong
          socialist organizers. YDSA is unique among student organizations in
          that we recognize our power comes not from our position as students,
          but as current and future members of the working class, and that our
          fight does not stop at the borders of our campuses or end when we
          graduate. As socialists, our strategy should be focused on elevating
          class consciousness and building the power and organization of the
          working class to extract concessions from the ruling class and
          eventually overturn capitalism itself. By engaging in rigorous
          political education and campaigning for concrete, widely-felt demands
          that shift the balance of power between capitalists and workers, YDSA
          members can build our skills as organizers and political thinkers,
          allowing us to reach and radicalize our fellow students, build
          stronger chapters, and prepare ourselves for lifetimes of commitment
          to militant socialist struggle.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, the widely disparate conditions on campuses across the
          country, the built-in rapid turnover imposed by graduation, and the
          general lack of clear organizational priorities have led to uneven
          development among chapters and a lack of coordination between chapters
          and national leadership.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, YDSA should take steps toward cohering an identity as a
          national organization, determining shared priorities and perspectives,
          and developing layers of trained organizers and leaders who can work
          together to build the base for a youth wing of a future mass party.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, YDSA should publicly declare the positions taken by the
          organization after the resurgence of the socialist movement and
          several conventions, including our commitments to building a fighting,
          democratic labor movement and the centrality of the labor movement to
          all socialist struggles; our support for reforms such as Medicare for
          All, College for All, a Green New Deal, and other demands that empower
          working people, nationalize key sectors of the economy, and counter
          austerity; and our understanding of the relationship between the fight
          for socialism and the struggles against racism, sexism, xenophobia,
          homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of oppression.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore be it resolved that YDSA will create a national Tasks and
          Perspectives document (hereafter known as “the document”) clarifying
          YDSA’s principles, priorities, and theory of change. This
          public-facing document will serve as a statement of purpose for the
          organization, and help to clarify organizational priorities, inform
          the creation of political education and propaganda materials, and
          provide direction for campaigns at the chapter level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the YDSA NCC will form a Tasks and
          Perspectives Committee (hereafter known as “the Committee”) to create
          a document within one month of the 2020 convention. The document will
          be informed by the resolutions passed at the 2020 convention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the preambulatory clauses of this
          resolution will be the foundations of the “Perspectives,” although
          they are subject to change by the Committee insofar as they agree with
          the spirit of resolutions adopted at convention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the document will be made available to
          chapter leaders for a comment and suggestion period of no more than
          one month, during which chapters will be encouraged to discuss the
          document and give feedback on its contents, which will be used to
          inform the Committee’s drafting process. Once the Committee
          incorporates any necessary changes, the Committee will make the
          document and any feedback available to the YDSA NCC, which will then
          vote to adopt or amend the Tasks and Perspectives Document.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the adopted document will be made
          immediately available to all YDSA members via email, and will be
          posted publicly on the YDSA website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that this document should be the basis for a
          national YDSA call open to all members to discuss the role of YDSA in
          the socialist movement and the role of students in the struggle for
          socialism.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be if further resolved that upon adoption of the Tasks and
          Perspectives document, YDSA chapters should be encouraged and/or
          expected to hold a chapter-wide strategy discussion about how best to
          relate to the national Tasks and Perspectives. The committee will
          provide, in addition to the completed document, a one-pager with
          guidance on how to hold such discussions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it finally resolved that YDSA calls on the DSA National Political
          Committee to create a process to adopt a similar strategy document.

            Click here to sign on to support our resolution on Developing a
            Robust National Political Education Program!
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas, rigorous political education is crucial for developing our
          members into lifelong socialist thinkers and organizers, and should be
          implemented in all chapters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, robust chapter political education programs help onboard
          newer members and give them the confidence necessary to become core
          organizers of their chapter, and bolster the confidence of existing
          core members by encouraging them to lead and participate in political
          discussion.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, incorporating political education into YDSA chapter meetings
          helps spark debate and discussion among membership, and encourages
          members to think of their local campaign work in a way that is closely
          informed by YDSA’s overall socialist vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, YDSA members rarely, if ever, discuss and debate politics
          with people outside their chapter, often creating uneven political
          development between chapters and a lack of shared strategic vision and
          goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, YDSA members should be trained to confidently and
          productively facilitate political discussions. Facilitation is a skill
          that is essential for successful political education meetings, but is
          also necessary in many other organizing contexts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore be it resolved that the NPEC will be tasked with creating a
          reading list for new members, covering a wide range of topics aimed at
          providing a grounding in socialist politics. The process for creating
          this syllabus will be directed by the NPEC, with any YDSA member able
          to submit suggestions for readings or topics to cover via an open
          submission process. This reading list will provide the basis for new
          member political education at the chapter level, although the
          membership of individual chapters can choose to alter the syllabus at
          their discretion. This new member political education at the chapter
          level can either take the form of one-on-one mentorships between older
          members and newer members, or of small discussion groups outside of
          the general meeting schedule. The NPEC will also prepare materials
          designed to help older members teach the syllabus and discuss material
          with newer members at the chapter level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that all chapters should be encouraged to
          incorporate political education into their general meeting schedule.
          This might involve alternating between organizing meetings and
          political education meetings week-by-week, or including both a
          political education and an organizing component within each general
          meeting, or some combination of different approaches; the membership
          of each chapter should feel free to experiment with whatever method
          works best for them. The NPEC will include materials on how to
          incorporate political education into a regular meeting schedule as
          part of the Night School handbook, and will offer mentorship and
          training for members who wish to become facilitators.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that this chapter-level political education
          will be supplemented with regular national calls focused on the topics
          presented in the readings, using a break-out group format to allow for
          maximum participation among individual YDSA members across chapters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the NPEC will regularly organize multiple
          week-long virtual political education intensives on different subjects
          of socialist theory and strategy for members across the country to
          take part in. These intensives will have a central curriculum planned
          by the NPEC and then carried out by trained facilitators in smaller
          groups of YDSAers. The smaller groupings should have members from all
          different chapters to facilitate cross-chapter political discussion
          and debate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the NPEC will also provide training and
          guidance for regional political education initiatives (e.g. in cities
          or states with a high concentration of YDSA chapters), encouraging
          members of more experienced chapters to train facilitators in newer
          chapters.
        </p>

        <p>
          Be it further resolved that the NPEC will also hold at least one call
          per semester on how to host night schools. These calls will help
          identify YDSA members who are willing and able to serve as
          facilitators for national calls and focused intensives. Members
          interested in facilitating will be mentored by members of the NPEC.

            Pipeline!
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> the labor movement must be central to any
          socialist strategy due to the structural power of the organized
          working class to extract concessions from the ruling class and the
          fact that unions are some of the most diverse working class
          institutions in the country. Labor organizing is both core to building
          socialist power and rooting the socialist movement in the multi-racial
          working class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> to rebuild the American labor and socialist
          movements, and to merge the two, socialists must have an orientation
          toward building shop floor power and developing a layer of
          rank-and-file leaders who can organize in the workplace on a
          day-to-day basis, often called the Rank-and-File Strategy (RFS). One
          key tactic of the RFS is having socialists take jobs in strategic, and
          often unionized, industries and workplaces.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> YDSA has a particular role within the
          socialist movement to develop life-long committed socialist organizers
          and send them into broader socialist and workplace struggles. YDSAers,
          having often not yet started careers, are in a unique position to
          carry out the tactic of taking a Rank-and-File union job in a
          strategic industry upon graduation, and in some unique situations,
          while still in school. Other YDSA members may be entering sectors
          where unionization is low, but where socialists can play a leading
          role in cohering and activating a militant minority, carrying out
          successful union drives, and increasing class consciousness amongst
          their coworkers.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> a number of YDSAers have already committed
          to pursuing the RFS as individuals, but have not had organizational
          support in this pursuit. By providing organizational support, those
          pursuing the RFS will be provided with mentorship, guidance, and a
          network of other socialists similarly pursuing the RFS in their
          preferred industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> many YDSA members are unable to
          industrialize or salt, but should nonetheless be provided with a
          socialist understanding of and orientation toward the labor movement.
          In all different conditions YDSAers should be encouraged and supported
          to take up efforts to support labor struggles in their campuses and
          communities, and provided with the knowledge, perspective, and
          connections to engage in new organizing in their workplaces
          post-graduation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Therefore be it resolved,</strong> YDSA will renew its
          commitment to the rank-and-file strategy as it was prioritized in
          National DSA Resolution 32, which emphasizes that the central focus of
          socialists “should be on identifying and developing a layer of rank
          and file leaders who can organize in the workplace on a day-to-day
          basis.”
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Resolved,</strong> YDSA’s NCC will establish the YDSA National
          Labor Committee (NLC) within two months of the 2020 YDSA National
          Convention.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Resolved,</strong> the NLC will consist of, but not be limited
          to, at least five committee members: one chair and four at-large
          committee members; and from these 5 members, 2 shall be appointed as
          Democratic Socialist Labor Commission (DSLC) Steering Committee
          Representatives.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Resolved,</strong> the YDSA NLC will work with the National
          Political Education Committee (NPEC) and the DLSC to develop political
          education materials about the history and current landscape of the
          labor movement (and the role socialists continue to play in it), the
          pitfalls of business unionism, and rank and file militancy, by
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Working with the National Political Education Committee to develop a
            curriculum around labor organizing and the rank-and-file strategy as
            part of the YDSA School of Socialism
          </li>
          <li>
            Running a national speaking tour for DSA labor organizers to speak
            to YDSA chapters in their region.
          </li>
          <li>Prioritizing labor as a topic for NPEC national calls</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Resolved,</strong> the NLC, working, where relevant, with
          DSA’s DSLC, will focus on building out a national YDSA rank-and-file
          graduation pipeline that will facilitate the process of connecting
          YDSAers with rank-and-file jobs in strategic industries, to be
          determined by the NLC, or salting opportunities upon graduation.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Resolved,</strong> the YDSA rank-and-file graduation pipeline
          will consist of, but not be limited to,
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            A yearly survey of all YDSA members to map out if members are
            interested in entering the labor movement upon graduation and which
            industries/in what capacity
            <ul>
              <li>
                This yearly survey data, along with information about DSA
                chapters with strong labor formations, should be used to map out
                “hot spots,” prioritizing state schools, community colleges,
                trade schools, and HBCUs/HSIs and connecting them to their local
                DSA labor formation
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Developing more pamphlets and educational materials like “Why
            Socialists should become Teachers” for more strategic industries
            such as logistics and healthcare
          </li>
          <li>
            Hosting national interest calls geared toward different industries
            with panels of rank-and-file organizers in the respective industry
          </li>
          <li>
            Hosting more in depth, recurring, rank-and-file schools for YDSAers
            nearing graduation who are seriously considering entering
            rank-and-file union jobs in strategic industries or salting
            unorganized workplaces, to connect them with labor organizers in the
            respective industry. These schools would cover the history of
            organizing in the industry and the contemporary terrain, provide
            workplace-specific organizing trainings, guide YDSAers in applying
            for these jobs, and connect them with pre-existing rank-and-file
            networks, caucuses, and organizers
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Resolved,</strong> for YDSAers unsure of committing to a
          career directly upon graduation, but still interested in building
          rank-and-file power and the labor movement, the National Labor
          Committee should work to connect YDSAers with unions with strong
          salting or new organizing programs to help organize the unorganized.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Be it finally resolved,</strong> YDSA recommits to campus
          labor organizing as an organizational priority, but will house said
          organizing work under the purview of relevant YDSA priority political
          campaigns. When necessary, the NLC will help connect YDSA members on
          different campuses who are engaged in campus labor organizing with
          each other and with experienced DSA labor organizers, and may hold
          national calls on the topic of campus labor organizing.

          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> as the youth section of the country’s
          largest socialist organization and in a time where there is mass
          unrest in response to racial injustice and police brutality, it is
          imperative that we do everything we can to be truly reflective of the
          working class.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> DSA as a whole has struggled with a lack of
          diversity, particularly in regards to race, thus hindering our ability
          to be reflective of the working class’ multiracial nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> YDSA has found particular success in
          diversifying our organization in a way that also roots us in the
          working class by investing in developing chapters at community
          colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and Minority
          Serving Institutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> YDSA has grown tremendously since 2016 from
          12 to 115 chapters at high schools, universities, community colleges,
          and HBCUs.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> YDSA has proven itself to be a key component
          for growing and diversifying DSA and the socialist movement as a
          whole, and in order to achieve DSA’s goal of 100,000-person
          membership, we must invest material resources into our organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Whereas,</strong> this is all to say we must intentionally
          recruit and train organizers at community colleges and HBCUs in
          particular so that we may improve our organizing, improve our
          representation of the working class, aid in unifying class struggle
          around both universal and particular struggles, and ultimately aid in
          creating a unified socialist movement that is anti-racist in action,
          and not only in name.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Therefore be it resolved,</strong> YYDSA’s National
          Coordinating Committee will be tasked with growing and diversifying
          our organization by, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Providing resources and material support for chapters so they can
            help form chapters in nearby community colleges, HBCUs, and high
            schools. These resources may include trainings on how to canvass a
            school; how to develop leaders; and trainings on how to use these
            various materials.
          </li>
          <li>
            Connecting YDSA chapters to corresponding DSA chapters in order to
            strengthen connections between YDSA and DSA chapters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pulling a list of DSA members who attend community colleges, HBCUs,
            and MSIs without YDSA chapters and executing targeted outreach
            towards these members in the hopes that they will establish chapters
            at their institutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuing to improve upon and execute the YDSA liaison program.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continuing to collaborate with AFROSOC to build chapters at HBCUs.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Be it further resolved,</strong> DSA’s Growth and Development
          committee is encouraged to thoughtfully and intentionally integrate
          YDSA into its 100K membership strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be it further resolved,</strong> YDSA calls upon DSA’s
          National Political Committee to prioritize hiring a second full-time
          staffer for YDSA, as promised in the October 2019 NPC meeting. We
          encourage the NPC to strongly consider hiring a POC/Black organizer
          who will be better equipped to recruit and develop organizers at
          community colleges and HBCUs.
