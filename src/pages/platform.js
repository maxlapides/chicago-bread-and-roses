        <h2>What We Built Through Bernie</h2>
        <p>
          Our chapter is coming off our biggest mobilization yet: a highly
          organized, all-volunteer, independent campaign for Bernie Sanders.
          Early on, Bernie wasn’t expected to win the Bay Area.{" "}
          <strong>
            East Bay DSA’s campaign led the way to Bernie’s victory here.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Dozens of new members became the leaders who developed our “Build the
          Bay for Bernie” program, distributed canvasses, fundraising, and
          socials. Through these efforts, we politicized and activated working
          people across the East Bay.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the Democratic Party lining up behind Biden,{" "}
          <strong>the working class rallied around Bernie’s platform</strong>{" "}
          and won California with a diverse coalition and exceptional support
          from young people and people of color, particularly Asian American,
          Pacific Islander and Latinx people. Hundreds of thousands in the East
          Bay voted for Bernie, and through our efforts we contacted and
          identified five thousand of them.
        </p>
      </Element>
      <Element name="triple-crisis" id="triple-crisis">
        <h2>The Triple Crisis</h2>
        <p>
          In the months since Bernie’s California victory, conditions have
          changed drastically, and <strong>we now face a triple crisis</strong>{" "}
          &mdash; a global pandemic that has killed thousands, a severe economic
          recession, and the political crisis of the global right wing’s racist
          response.
        </p>

        <p>
          COVID-19 has already claimed the lives of thousands of working-class
          people, disproportionately Black and Brown, and our country’s uniquely
          cruel healthcare system has left millions in danger due to lack of
          equipment and inability to pay. Massive unemployment is costing more
          workers their health insurance every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          The powerful are using this disaster to muscle through their agenda of
          profiteering, austerity, and privatization. We’ve already seen massive
          budget cuts and corporate bailouts, and more are on the horizon.
          Meanwhile, millions can’t pay rent and are going into debt to afford
          basic necessities.
        </p>

        <p>
          A rising far right blames immigrants, seeking to restrict their
          freedom of movement, strip them of rights, and imprison them and their
          families. As economies collapse, political instability and jingoism
          increase, the level of hostility escalates, and so does the likelihood
          of international conflict. Climate change remains a looming threat,
          while prospects for international collaboration on climate issues
          evaporate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile our flawed democratic institutions are being further eroded
          through mass voter disenfranchisement, consolidating political power
          for the capitalist class and their allies.

        <h2>The Working Class Fights Back</h2>
        <p>
          But workers are fighting back! Frontline workers, disproportionately
          women and people of color, are taking action to get better pay and
          protections, and tenants are withholding rent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to the crisis, the Bernie campaign heightened class
          consciousness and an appetite for democratic socialist politics across
          the multiracial working class. Between raised expectations from the
          Bernie campaign and increasing desperation from the economic crisis,
          there are thousands of newly radicalized working-class people in the
          East Bay.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Right now, DSA's task is to bring newly inspired Bernie supporters
            and newly activated workers together into one movement powerful
            enough to challenge the ruling class.
          </strong>{" "}
          On the one hand, we must root "Not Me, Us!" in the working class who,
          by withholding their labor, have the power to bring capitalists to
          their knees. On the other, we must inspire organized labor and new
          militants to wage campaigns for structural reforms that combat
          oppression and protect and expand vital public services.

        <h3>
          Rebuilding a militant, democratic, and left-wing labor movement by
          supporting and joining the rank-and-file
        </h3>
        <p>
          COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that there are two classes —
          owners, who send us to work where we might catch a deadly virus, and
          workers whose only interest is survival. This has spurred workers to
          organize to shut down workplaces and get personal protective equipment
          and hazard pay. We need to build this upsurge of rank-and-file
          militancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            We support a{" "}

            </ExternalLink>{" "}
            to rebuild a militant, democratic, and left-wing labor movement.
          </strong>{" "}
          The key to this strategy is developing rank-and-file worker-leaders
          permanently organizing in the workplace. These leaders are often, but
          not always, self-identified socialists. Rank-and-file takeovers of
          labor unions will turn enormous resources towards strikes and
          organizing the unorganized, at a greater scale than NGO-style
          organizing efforts can.
        </p>

        <p>
          We can rebuild this militant layer in a few ways — taking union jobs
          where we can identify and cohere organic leaders and reform existing
          unions, taking jobs in non-union workplaces in order to organize, and
          supporting workers already taking action. Concretely, East Bay DSA
          should:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Build a rank-and-file jobs pipeline in our chapter.</strong>{" "}
            With many members furloughed or unemployed, we can organize
            ourselves into strategic industries and build working-class
            militancy, including in unorganized workplaces. We should support
            YDSA activists joining the rank-and-file as they graduate. Activists
            entering the labor movement should get resources and mentorship from
            seasoned organizers.

        <p>
          We must always connect our fight back to the struggle against racism —
          especially as the pandemic devastates communities of color suffering
          disproportionate infection and mortality rates.
        </p>

        <p>
          The roots of this disparity go back to this country’s racist
          foundations and the perpetuation of racism as a ruling ideology.
          People of color are more likely to work low-paid jobs, are less likely
          to have benefits, be able to work from home, have savings, and be able
          to afford not to work. This has meant vicious segregation of Black and
          Latinx people by employers, landlords, and banks. Austerity,
          gentrification, and police brutality have crushed the promise of
          Oakland’s working class.

        <p>
          Our natural allies in the fight against austerity are rank-and-file

          We can’t reach millions of Bernie voters and newly radicalized workers

            mass political action
          </ExternalLink>{" "}
          is rooting ourselves in the multiracial working class. Bernie’s
          campaign demonstrated that democratic socialism excites a diverse
          base, but East Bay DSA’s composition doesn’t reflect that. This should
          be urgently addressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            If we want multiracial, working-class recruitment, we need dedicated
            organizing and recruitment.
          </strong>{" "}
          We should root this work in our campaigns and build on tactics from
          the Bernie campaign like our successful “Build the Bay for Bernie”
          canvass series, distributed organizing team, and relational organizing
          models. We should also launch recruitment-focused events across the
          East Bay, starting in areas like San Leandro, Hayward, East Oakland,
          and Richmond where we deepened our roots through campaigning for
          Bernie.

        <p>
          <strong>
            Becoming a mass organization also requires us to make our chapter
            more democratic and give members control over substantive decisions
          </strong>{" "}
          while limiting procedural debates and avoiding infighting. The
          Steering Committee shouldn’t be a purely administrative body, but a
          political body that seeks to identify and frame important political
          questions and build a culture of engaging, comradely debate at our
          General Meetings and throughout the chapter. To build a diverse and
          dynamic chapter, we should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Launch a recruitment campaign to diversify the chapter.
            </strong>{" "}
            We should develop efforts to diversify our ranks by organizing
            recruitment events, continuing to build YDSA chapters around the
            East Bay that recruit young organizers from varied backgrounds, and
            proactively recruiting from our lists from Bernie and other
            campaigns.

            comrades and building our translation team.

            <strong>Build leadership development engines</strong> that promote
            the development of non-white and non-male leaders. As we diversify

            as well.

          <li>
            <strong>Expand our mobilizers program</strong> with three goals — to
            check on our members and contacts during COVID-19, plug them into
            campaigns and political education, and activate them as socialist
            organizers. We should also continue our organizer trainings and more
            explicitly link them to our campaigns.

          <li>
            <strong>Take an organizing approach to our democracy.</strong> We
            should actively turn out members to our General Meetings and loop
            them into relevant debates, so they can decide where they stand on
            the substantive political questions facing our chapter.

        <p>
          Over 2 million Californians voted for Bernie in 2020. Through DSA’s
          Bernie campaign we spoke to over five thousand Bernie supporters
          throughout the East Bay and DSA has seen its membership surge in the
          wake of his campaign. At the same time, labor unions, cultural
          organizations, and groups like Mijente, Dream Defenders, and the
          Sunrise Movement endorsed Bernie and fought for his democratic
          socialist platform.

        <p>
          These are our allies in struggles for our shared priorities and{" "}

          Bernie didn’t win the primary, but his campaign activated millions of
          new socialists across this country. For those inspired by that
          campaign, who fought for someone they didn’t know, DSA is their
          political home. Our job is to welcome them home. To do that, we
